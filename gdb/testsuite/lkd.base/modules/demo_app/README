This software is meant to provide a basic demo case of the kptrace 
tracing tool. 

fake_alsa.c is a driver that simulates a hardware contention that leads
to a delay in a blocking read completion, and hence to a sensible flaw 
in the realtime processing.  

fake_app.c is the client application of the driver, is creates a reader
thread that waits for data buffers doing blocking reads, and a processing
thread that speeps until new available buffers are notfied by a semaphore. 

env.sh.exemple is a sample script for setting the build variables for 
the sh4 toolset. 

env.arm.exemple is a sample script for setting the build variables for 
the ARM toolset.

my_makedev is a helper script to be called after a character driver
was loaded, in order to create the device files in /dev. 
example: my_makedev bob   creates /dev/bob_dev, provides bob.ko 
waas loaded, and "bob" shows up in /proc/devices. notice that sed 
must be available in the linux distro (not the basic one from busybox). 


build for intel, native : $>make
build for ARM : source env.arm.exemple ; make other
