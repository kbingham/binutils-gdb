The Linux Awareness target is a GDB target meant to provide efficient support
for Linux kernel debugging through JTAG.  Most commands and features can be
listed thanks to:

(gdb) help STM
(gdb) show linux-awareness

The code in this folder is indent according to GNU / Linux coding style (sigh),
performing "indent *.[ch]" in this folder is fine.
